# comfyui-NDI
NDI input and output functionality to the ComfyUI.

Leveraging the powerful linking capabilities of NDI, you can access NDI video stream frames and send images generated by the model to NDI video streams.

For example, you can use your web camera as the input for your model, or capture the screen of a Painting software (such as PS) as input, and so on. 

If you have any requirements, please let me know.

have fun!
